      description: `This book is a collections of ideas, stories, lessons, and values
        which I believe are timeless. I wrote this during the COVID-19 pandemic
        right after my son was born. I thought a lot about if something 
        were to happen to me, what would I want my kids to know about life? This was
        a lot of fun to put together and I even taught myself how to use pixel art
        drawing software in order to design the cover and illustrations.`,
